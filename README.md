# Synthesis Field
try it for yourself on my website [here](https://randielzoquier.com/web_projects/synthfield/)!

## What does it do?

Users can create an evolving drone synth sound by placing nodes on the field and adjusting their position. Each node has 3 oscillators which are affected by various aspects of the node's position. Here is a list of general positional mappings:

* __Y axis:__ pitch based on a C major scale
* __X axis:__ panning from left to right
* __Distance from the center:__ volume and lowpass filter frequency.

There is also a few layers of frequency, amplitude, and filter modulation for each individual node, based on their coordinate position as well as their rotational position around the center axis.

Nodes gravitate toward each other if they are close enough, which creates an added effect of change over time.

A waveform of each node is displayed at the center of the screen, matching the color of the node itself.

## Other features

  You can choose to delete nodes after you have placed them by switching to the "erase" function. There is also a recording feature if you want to record the sound that the synth makes. The note scale used can also be changed if you want the drone to be in a specific key.

## Future features

  Nothing else planned at the moment!
